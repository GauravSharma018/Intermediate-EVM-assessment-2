# Solidity integrated with Frontend (Project)
This is a smart contract written in Solidity. The purpose is to create a simple contract with 2-3 functions and then show the values of those functions in frontend of the application. 

# Getting Stared
Proficiency in Hardhat: It is essential to have a good grasp of using Hardhat, a development environment designed for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
Understanding of Solidity: It is important to have a strong understanding of Solidity as it is the main programming language used for creating smart contracts in this codebase.
Command line proficiency: Basic familiarity with using command line tools such as the terminal or Command Prompt is necessary for running commands and scripts.

## Installing
A text editor: For running the code Visual Studio Code.
You will need to have Node.js installed on your system, with version V10. or higher.
Node Package Manager npm used for installing and managing dependencies.
Run this command in your terminal git clone https://github.com/GauravSharma018/Intermediate-EVM-assessment-2 to clone this repository

## Executing The program
After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
